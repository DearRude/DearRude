### Dorood ðŸ‘‹

Just another **Computer Science** student.

Interested in GIS Data Analysis and Data Engineering in general.
Here's by [blog](https://blog.nejati.net) (in Persian mostly), which you can follow by its [RSS](https://blog.nejati.net/feed) feed.
[Email](mailto:enejati@mail.um.ac.ir) me for my resume if interested.
I use NixOS ~and Arch btw~.

**I don't use Github** mainly for hosting my repos. I use it as a just-to-have place for some collaborative projects and mostly for opening issue and stuff. You can find me on [self-hosted gitea](https://git.markpash.net/dearrude/), [SourceHut](https://sr.ht/~dearrude/) and [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/dearrude).

  <small>NOTE: Top Languages does not indicate my skill level or anything like that, it's a GitHub metric of which languages have the most code on GitHub</small>
